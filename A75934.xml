            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I preÅ¿ent a CatechiÅ¿m unto you who are able to inÅ¿truct others: and a mothers CatechiÅ¿m for her children, when you have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your own under your inÅ¿truction now. This may Å¿eem Å¿trange to them that know not you to be to me a great encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to this little work: &amp; to them that are ignorant of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a common good: You have had experience of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb facs="tcp:153032:10"/> and profit of it in your family, and in the Congregation over which you care; and you will have me do Å¿ome little good by it (as you think) to others that may Å¿ee, and uÅ¿e it. The bleÅ¿sing of God be upon it: and their bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing fall upon you <hi>(if they receive good by it)</hi> who have bin the main cauÅ¿e, under God, of my Å¿etting it forth. I confeÅ¿Å¿e that I have, thus many yeares laÅ¿t paÅ¿t, been Å¿olici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by many well minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who have had the benefit of my private exerciÅ¿es) to have let this unpoliÅ¿hed birth to walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many houÅ¿es; But being loath to hold out a little candle to a quick-Å¿ighted age; or to prevent the more elaborate endeavours of my learned brethren, I have Å¿hut it up, rather in my head, where it Å¿tuck by judgment, and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<pb facs="tcp:153032:10"/> then under my pen, which is not Å¿o happy as my tongue, in this kinde. But now being overcome by your LadyÅ¿hips entreating-commands, and commanding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; I can hold it a priÅ¿oner, no longer. I let it looÅ¿e from my head and heart, to my pen, and paper, and from thence to every EngliÅ¿h Å¿oul, to be either embraced, or rejected according to preÅ¿ent fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie. If it prove un-Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿efull, I'le bear the blame; who, as an old man being ready to deny my Å¿elf a being in this world, have a little learned to deny my Å¿elf in this, and Å¿uffer words of diminution: But if it prove acceptable to <hi>ChriÅ¿ts Church,</hi> and profitable to his meaneÅ¿t Members; you <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)</hi> Å¿hall have the thanks, and credit, under whoÅ¿e wings it hath found leiÅ¿ure to be born.

But, I beÅ¿eech you be wary. To praiÅ¿e that which deÅ¿erves it not, may Å¿peak well of your affections, but diÅ¿commend your judgment: and I would not have you engage where it may be a prejudice to you in the iÅ¿Å¿ue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this little TreatiÅ¿e is a <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿m.</hi> And whereas preaching is a Å¿peaking unto men to <hi>inÅ¿tructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

                  <p>Whether it be worthy others view or no, it will be acceptable to them that love and deÅ¿ire it; and Å¿o, I humbly preÅ¿ent it to you (Madam). Though you have no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of your own, but they that are above theÅ¿e inÅ¿tructions; yet have you many grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom, like Olive-branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, you rejoyce to Å¿ee about your table. TheÅ¿e, it may be, may be under them, and by the uÅ¿e of this book, grace may by little &amp; little,
<pb facs="tcp:153032:12"/> drop like dew upon them. Be but as you are, like <hi>Timothy his mother and grand-mother</hi> (who trained him from a childe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) to train them up in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as they come about you; and they will, in after time, thank God that they had Å¿uch a grand-mother.

<pb facs="tcp:153032:15"/> of the Lord, and comfort of the holy GhoÅ¿t, as the Churches of Judea did, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they had reÅ¿t round about. But whether he Å¿torm you Å¿till with the fear of war, and bloud-Å¿hed; or wrap you up in the Å¿weet Å¿wadling bands of peace; you are aloft, even both of you above your neighbors, to be made a Å¿pectacle to the world, angels, and men. Therefore let the counÅ¿ell of a poor friend be acceptable unto you Å¿o to live that ye be not <hi>Å¿wallowed</hi> up of Å¿orrow, Å¿o to live, as ye be not <hi>devoured</hi> by peace. As it was Å¿aid of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> of old, Å¿o may it of proÅ¿perity, and adverÅ¿ity, that <hi>adverÅ¿ity</hi> hath Å¿lain <hi>1000.</hi> but <hi>proÅ¿perity 10000.</hi> It is a glorious thing to be in proÅ¿perity, and not to be worÅ¿e. It is a glorious thing alÅ¿o to be in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ity and to be better. But to be bad in both is to make both a curÅ¿e: proÅ¿perity, to be made a Å¿weet Ladder from which to break our necks from, when we think we are climbed up to heaven: and adverÅ¿ity to be a Å¿owr Ladder to let us down into hell here, and to bring us at laÅ¿t to the burning Lake which torments for evermore. The only way to help all this is, both in proÅ¿perity, and adverÅ¿ity, to live in ChriÅ¿t.

As to the firÅ¿t faults, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e them, and, in truth, I make this but as a fore-runner to a larger CatechiÅ¿m, thorough the whole body of Divinity. If God Å¿end me health, life, and leiÅ¿ure, you may Å¿ee that, (if this, mean while be acceptable to the Church) and it will more copiouÅ¿ly handle all the

For when you are warming your own and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens hearts with it, I will follow it with my prayers to make it Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿efull. Could I do more, I would do it: Could I do leÅ¿Å¿e, I would not: As becomes him that hath been, is, and (by Gods bleÅ¿sing) will be, to both of you (worthy Ladies)</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Noble Friends,</hi> God hath joyned you together by bloud, and marriage, and I durÅ¿t not Å¿eparate one from the other. It is all your goods I ayme at, and therefore I reÅ¿olved not to make one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to another for a gift, but all to bee thankefull to that Noble Mother, who Å¿et me on work. On my part, I can do
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:153032:131"/> nothing that may deÅ¿erve a publike eye: but if others think otherwiÅ¿e, I cannot help it. If they tell me that I have a talent; I have known that a long time. If they tell me it may profit by way of preaching, I muÅ¿t put that to the Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e which Gods bleÅ¿sing will give it. If they tell me it may profit by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, here onely I Å¿tick. I am altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what I can do in this kinde. I have nothing to direct me but others opinions and deÅ¿ires: and if they be no Å¿ure Cards and CompaÅ¿Å¿es to Å¿ail by into this cenÅ¿uring world, I may Å¿uffer Å¿hipwrack. HowÅ¿oever it fall out, I muÅ¿t now take my Lot, and if with <hi>Jonas</hi> I be caÅ¿t into the Sea, it is becauÅ¿e I have obeyed, and not becauÅ¿e I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled. It is poÅ¿sible for a man to know when he is called to do any work, though it be a work of hazard. He is called, Å¿urely, when he hath a voice from heaven to deÅ¿igne him as <hi>Paul</hi> had; and when he hath a particular inÅ¿tinct of Å¿pirit, as many worthies in the firÅ¿t ages; and when he hath the propheÅ¿ies go of him, as <hi>Timothy</hi> had; and when he hath the approbation, and impoÅ¿ition of hands of the ElderÅ¿hip, as ordinary Å¿ervants of ChriÅ¿t for the benefit of the Church, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tours, and Teachers have; or laÅ¿tly, when
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:153032:131"/> he hath the engagement of the hearts of Gods people attending upon his diÅ¿penÅ¿ing of the myÅ¿teries of grace, and preÅ¿sing the publike uÅ¿e of what he doth more privately. As I have had long ago, and ever Å¿ince, Å¿ome comfortable approbation at, and Å¿ince the impoÅ¿ition of hands, Å¿o have I had Å¿ome clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing of the hearts of the godly, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the publike, of what I have done in this Å¿ervice, in the private. This I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an invitation to do Å¿omething by the pen, as well as in the Pulpit. As I would not be Å¿o running out, as to make all my diviner thoughts viÅ¿ible to the Sunne (becauÅ¿e there are many that can do it better): Å¿o would I not be Å¿o bound up, as to be unwilling to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Å¿ome in this way, though others may think it not worth the looking on. That which is as gold to Å¿ome, may be as braÅ¿Å¿e to others: and that which is as Å¿ilver to Å¿ome, is as lead to others: and yet variety of Å¿pirits may be helped according to various touches, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿sions, of fancies, judgements, concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and opinions from the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t.</p>
                  <p>I therefore being emboldened to do Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this kinde, was not long to Å¿tudy to whoÅ¿e hands to preÅ¿ent it firÅ¿t, and thence to have it derived to all <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> hands, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:153032:132"/> hearts, that we are willing to receive it. To you therefore <hi>(my noble friends)</hi> is it come, onely craving your acceptance, according to the worth of the matter, not of the perÅ¿on that exhibits it unto you. I am a poor old man, clogged with many infirmities, who have been toÅ¿Å¿ed, and bandied up, and down in the world; who yet, want nothing but a fuller meaÅ¿ure of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t to dwell in my Å¿oul by faith. I have learned you the fountains of Å¿ecret Å¿innes, and the means how to diÅ¿cover them in your Å¿elves, that it may bow you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of heaven, to make you fit to hold JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. It muÅ¿t be an hollow veÅ¿Å¿el which muÅ¿t hold water, and an hollowed heart; that muÅ¿t lye under the fountain of <hi>David</hi> for Å¿in and for uncleanneÅ¿Å¿e, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the water of life to the Å¿oul. I have taught you the worth of the Glorious GoÅ¿pel, that you may be willing to hunt after ChriÅ¿t, and, when you have found him, to part with all that is yours for his embracements. And, becauÅ¿e your precious Å¿ouls are in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in theÅ¿e diÅ¿tracted dayes, both by proÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and adverÅ¿ity, I have learned you, from the beÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿urance office in the world, to Å¿ecure your Å¿ouls; that while you enjoy them you may have faith, while you have faith, you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:153032:132"/> may have ChriÅ¿t, and while you have ChriÅ¿t, you may have the love of God for your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good.</p>
                  <p>I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e, that if ever ChriÅ¿tian Å¿ouls were in danger, they are in danger now. We are faln <hi>into the laÅ¿t, and perillous dayes:</hi> wherein while the Drum, and Canon are the beÅ¿t muÅ¿ick, and CommiÅ¿sion is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Å¿word to cut off not a few, and to guild the Land with crying bloud; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Å¿owes tares to an aboundance at home, to the hinderance of Reformation, and to the disjoynting of many a good Å¿oul. Some of the ancient exploded hereÅ¿ies are revived; and Å¿uch wide ruptures are made, that a devout Å¿oul can Å¿carce tell at which dore to go in to ChriÅ¿t: my heart bleeds to Å¿ee with what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and violence private opinions are maintained. I beleeve that I may have Å¿ome private opinion, of my own; but I will rather bury it within my breaÅ¿t, then Å¿uffer it to make a publike diÅ¿turbance. If others would do Å¿o too, we might (it may be) have been wafted to our wiÅ¿hed for haven before this day. But (alas) all cry up the ways of ChriÅ¿t, the ordinances of ChriÅ¿t, the Kingdome of Christ; but when it comes to be examined it is found to be nothing but Å¿elf opinions, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:153032:133"/> Å¿elf practiÅ¿es. Some look upon the Law as a School-maÅ¿ter unto ChriÅ¿t, and, when they have learned him, they would walk in ChriÅ¿t, not onely by beleeving, but by doing, Å¿uch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; charitable duties as the Law propounds and commands. Some would have no uÅ¿e of the Law among ChriÅ¿tians, but pin all upon faith, as if faith did not work by love. Some look upon BaptiÅ¿m as unuÅ¿efull in our Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, though the beginning of it cannot be concludently grounded but from the ApoÅ¿tles, and the practiÅ¿e of it was never oppoÅ¿ed till this laÅ¿t age. Some are for the grafting of it into the place of CircumciÅ¿ion; becauÅ¿e it can be no other then that was, <hi>A Å¿igne and Å¿eal of the righteouÅ¿nes of faith:</hi> and God, <hi>who caleth things that are not as if they were,</hi> calleth, by vertue of his Covenant, Infants of ChriÅ¿tians <hi>Believers,</hi> much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> infants of Jews. Some again are for Congregationall Churches onely, as if ChriÅ¿t had given any Å¿uch precept, or as if there were any Å¿uch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e according to undoubted rule. Others will have ClaÅ¿sicall Churches under Å¿weet and amiable Å¿ubordination to help the Communion of Saints, as in the dayes of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Some would have excommunication in the power of the whole Body; Å¿ome in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:153032:133"/> power of the Presbytery; Å¿ome in the power of a mixt Presbytery, Å¿ome of an ElderÅ¿hip of MiniÅ¿tery, which Å¿eemes to be the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t way; and Å¿ome would have none at all, though, happly, if excommunication be not a <hi>delivering over to Satan;</hi> yet it may, juÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be a wary <hi>caÅ¿ting out,</hi> and removing Å¿tones of offence till they are humbled, and reformed. Some would have all puniÅ¿hments in the power of the MagiÅ¿trate; Å¿ome would have none but for Å¿uch faults as claÅ¿h againÅ¿t Publique Peace of the Common-wealth: though it cannot be denied, but that the Å¿word of a good MagiÅ¿trate, for vertue, and againÅ¿t vice is a back of Steele to a good MiniÅ¿tery. Some are for admittance of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church by I know not what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (becauÅ¿e it is variouÅ¿ly practiÅ¿ed). Others know no covenant but that of grace, made in BaptiÅ¿me, and renewed in the Supper of the Lord, except voluntary Covenants, and according to the Rules of ChriÅ¿tian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Now <hi>(my much honoured friends)</hi> when theÅ¿e digladiations are Å¿harpned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t good men, great men, will it not be a beame in the eye of many a good Å¿oul, even to hinder them from walking with Å¿uch a Å¿teady foot, in the wayes of ChriÅ¿t, as were to be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:153032:134"/> wiÅ¿hed? I know no better way to help all, then to follow <hi>Melancthons</hi> counÅ¿ell to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when Å¿he was troubled with the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ies of her time, <hi>that Å¿he Å¿tick to her old principles of Å¿aving doctrine, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿e,</hi> and for the reÅ¿t to wait the iÅ¿Å¿ue of Gods providence. This is my humble, and hearty counÅ¿ell to you all. Look upon the goodneÅ¿Å¿e of every good man, and Å¿o far as you Å¿ee ChriÅ¿t in them, Å¿o far honour, and Å¿uccour them: but for other opinions engage you not. It will be more unÅ¿eemly at laÅ¿t to caÅ¿t out an errour, upon further triall, then not to admit it at firÅ¿t. God hath his mighty work in theÅ¿e Å¿tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, for the cleering of Å¿ome truths, yet, more confuÅ¿edly known. When this is brought unto an iÅ¿Å¿ue, it will more Å¿weetly content you, then a preÅ¿ent engagement in the premiÅ¿es of many Å¿tirring Å¿pirits who do too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themÅ¿elves and others. This is all I ayme at, and therefore preÅ¿ent you with old quiet grounds of faith, and practiÅ¿e, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth me who am the Å¿ervant of JeÅ¿us Christ, and under him</p>

God can make our garments <hi>white</hi> by the <hi>bloud</hi> of the Lamb. He that could create all things of nothing, can create clean hearts, and hands, againÅ¿t all the world.</p>
                     <p>Only be Å¿ure that you caÅ¿t your Å¿elves upon God for the purity of your Å¿ouls <hi>against all Å¿innes</hi> whatÅ¿oever, open, and Å¿ecret. God will not cleanÅ¿e one except you be weary of, &amp; are willing to cleanÅ¿e all. One favoured Å¿inne is like a dead flye which corrupts the whole boxe of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:153032:151"/> ointment. Have you Å¿ouls to cleanÅ¿e? Have you a Saviour to cleanÅ¿e them by his bloud, Å¿pirit, and word? Engage your Saviour to this work, and put the whole work to this Saviour in his way, or elÅ¿e you Å¿hew but little care of your Å¿ouls. Remember what one Å¿aid well of old: thou haÅ¿t two <hi>eyes,</hi> if one be out, the other will help thee to Å¿ee: two <hi>ears,</hi> if one be Å¿topt, the other will help thee to hear: two <hi>hands,</hi> if one be cut off, the other will help thee to work: two <hi>feet,</hi> if one be lame, the other will help thee to walk: but thou haÅ¿t but one <hi>Soul,</hi> loÅ¿e that, and loÅ¿e all; let that lye rotting in Å¿inne, thou letteÅ¿t all thou haÅ¿t lye rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Take heed: be not Å¿o deÅ¿perately prodigal. Let this day be the laÅ¿t day of thy preÅ¿umptuous Å¿inning: put thy Å¿oul upon God both againÅ¿t <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>Å¿ecret</hi> Å¿innes; and for theÅ¿e laÅ¿t, go in his way of righteouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e, and holineÅ¿Å¿e, and cry out unto him; <hi>Lord, cleanÅ¿e me from my Å¿ecret Faults. Amen.</hi>
