            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I preſent a Catechiſm unto you who are able to inſtruct others: and a mothers Catechiſm for her children, when you have no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your own under your inſtruction now. This may ſeem ſtrange to them that know not you to be to me a great encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to this little work: &amp; to them that are ignorant of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a common good: You have had experience of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb facs="tcp:153032:10"/> and profit of it in your family, and in the Congregation over which you care; and you will have me do ſome little good by it (as you think) to others that may ſee, and uſe it. The bleſsing of God be upon it: and their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fall upon you <hi>(if they receive good by it)</hi> who have bin the main cauſe, under God, of my ſetting it forth. I confeſſe that I have, thus many yeares laſt paſt, been ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by many well minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who have had the benefit of my private exerciſes) to have let this unpoliſhed birth to walk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many houſes; But being loath to hold out a little candle to a quick-ſighted age; or to prevent the more elaborate endeavours of my learned brethren, I have ſhut it up, rather in my head, where it ſtuck by judgment, and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<pb facs="tcp:153032:10"/> then under my pen, which is not ſo happy as my tongue, in this kinde. But now being overcome by your Ladyſhips entreating-commands, and commanding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; I can hold it a priſoner, no longer. I let it looſe from my head and heart, to my pen, and paper, and from thence to every Engliſh ſoul, to be either embraced, or rejected according to preſent fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. If it prove un-ſucceſſefull, I'le bear the blame; who, as an old man being ready to deny my ſelf a being in this world, have a little learned to deny my ſelf in this, and ſuffer words of diminution: But if it prove acceptable to <hi>Chriſts Church,</hi> and profitable to his meaneſt Members; you <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam)</hi> ſhall have the thanks, and credit, under whoſe wings it hath found leiſure to be born. I
<pb facs="tcp:153032:11"/> know that you will be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to ſome of your friends, if not out of ſelf-worth, yet out of a conceit and expectation of ſome ſuch like thing. But, I beſeech you be wary. To praiſe that which deſerves it not, may ſpeak well of your affections, but diſcommend your judgment: and I would not have you engage where it may be a prejudice to you in the iſſue. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this little Treatiſe is a <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</hi> And whereas preaching is a ſpeaking unto men to <hi>inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

                     <hi>edification,</hi> and <hi>comfort;</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing is a ſpeaking to men for <hi>inſtruction</hi> mainly: preaching is a dilating of one member of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into a body; Catechiſing is the contracting of the whole into a a ſum: Preaching is for all ſorts; Catechiſing for the yong, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: this may commend the
<pb facs="tcp:153032:11"/> work, if the workman were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, and, <hi>as a Maſter-builder did lay the foundation.</hi> But I know not how it fals out; this Treatiſe is much, in a little, and that little derived from the capacitie of a mother, to the capacity of a child: &amp; therfore can promiſe nothing, but poorneſſe of judgement, and plain-neſſe of affections.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be worthy others view or no, it will be acceptable to them that love and deſire it; and ſo, I humbly preſent it to you (Madam). Though you have no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your own, but they that are above theſe inſtructions; yet have you many grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom, like Olive-branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, you rejoyce to ſee about your table. Theſe, it may be, may be under them, and by the uſe of this book, grace may by little &amp; little,
<pb facs="tcp:153032:12"/> drop like dew upon them. Be but as you are, like <hi>Timothy his mother and grand-mother</hi> (who trained him from a childe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) to train them up in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they come about you; and they will, in after time, thank God that they had ſuch a grand-mother. I pray to our good God, that this little Book may but help you a little; and it hath done all the work I can expect from you.</p>

In the time of the Law, God commanded to <hi>whet the Word</hi> upon their children by catechiſing:
<note place="margin"> Deut. 6.7.</note> in which they were ſo punctual, that under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and after to Chriſt, the <hi>Rabbies</hi> report in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> not fewer then 400. houſes for catechiſing. This made the

<note place="margin"> Luk. 1.4. Act. 18.</note> In the time of the Goſpel, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> were catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<note place="margin"> Gal. 6.6.</note> ſo God appointeth a great reward for Catechizers, <hi>even to be made partakers of all our goods.</hi> Now, for the fruit of <hi>Catechiſing;</hi> certainly it brings a more diſtinct knowledge of the grounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; a good entrance to eat the <hi>ſtronger meat</hi> of the Scriptures; &amp; to learn us to make an <hi>Hedge of Divinity,</hi> to encloſe, all our read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp; hearings from the word, within their proper bounds, for the ſetling of our judgments, and raiſing up our affections inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. This was ſeen well enough of old. Therefore an Ancient hath obſerved, that, <hi>by vertue of
<pb facs="tcp:153032:13"/> Catechiſing, there was never a King in the world, but ſuffered altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Heatheniſh Religion within forty years after Chriſt:</hi> and the greateſt enemy that ever the Chriſtian Religion had <hi>(Iulian the Perſecuter),</hi> left off inventing of torments, and <hi>put down Schools of Learning, and Catechiſings,</hi> the onely ways to build up Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. By how much more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable it is, and by how much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe it hath had, by ſo much the more (Madam) love, reſpect, and countenance it in all yours.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe that this work will help but a little, very little: but better a little, then nothing at this excellent work. We finde in theſe diſtracted times, the foundation mightily deſerted, and ſome of them ſhaken:

After dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cuſtome hath prevailed to draw out an Epiſtle to the Readers: and becauſe I know not who will read my Book; or, if I did, I had little to ſay to them, but wiſh them and theirs as much good as I intend by it: Therefore, becauſe I am ſure, that if it fall into either of your hands, you will reade, and reade, and make uſe of it, for the benefit of your good children; I cannot but expreſſe my intentions fully to you both. God hath ſet you in high
<pb facs="tcp:153032:15"/> places above many others: and though the Waves have gone over you, and <hi>(it may be cauſeleſly)</hi> have entered into your ſouls, by loſſes, croſſes, and vexations in great proximity to you both (though to one more then to the other): yet, as when the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> appeared upon the ſlacking of the floud, <hi>the Ark</hi> reſted upon the top of them, and <hi>Noah</hi> could eaſily eſpie them, when other hillocks, trees, and ſhrubs lay covered with waters: ſo when the waters of your miſeries leſſen, and by the favour of God and man, are dried up, you ſtand aloft, and the Church can look earneſtly at you, when others yet lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloud of ſinne, and ſorrow. I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore, that, ſeeing men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are like <hi>Jaacobs</hi> ſheep, which conceived by the eye, all gazers may ſee you ſo to ſteer your courſes, that they may behold in you both examples of <hi>fortitude</hi> to out-face the daring world; of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> to bridle tongues, &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in evill times; and of <hi>confidence</hi> to live above the higheſt waves in <hi>the rock of your ſalvation.</hi> God ſeems to ſmile upon us a little with the ſweet beams of peace, thorough a thick cloud, and it is to be hoped, that God hath other graces in you to be acted in ſuch a time, for your edification, walking in the fear
<pb facs="tcp:153032:15"/> of the Lord, and comfort of the holy Ghoſt, as the Churches of Judea did, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had reſt round about. But whether he ſtorm you ſtill with the fear of war, and bloud-ſhed; or wrap you up in the ſweet ſwadling bands of peace; you are aloft, even both of you above your neighbors, to be made a ſpectacle to the world, angels, and men. Therefore let the counſell of a poor friend be acceptable unto you ſo to live that ye be not <hi>ſwallowed</hi> up of ſorrow, ſo to live, as ye be not <hi>devoured</hi> by peace. As it was ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> of old, ſo may it of proſperity, and adverſity, that <hi>adverſity</hi> hath ſlain <hi>1000.</hi> but <hi>proſperity 10000.</hi> It is a glorious thing to be in proſperity, and not to be worſe. It is a glorious thing alſo to be in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity and to be better. But to be bad in both is to make both a curſe: proſperity, to be made a ſweet Ladder from which to break our necks from, when we think we are climbed up to heaven: and adverſity to be a ſowr Ladder to let us down into hell here, and to bring us at laſt to the burning Lake which torments for evermore. The only way to help all this is, both in proſperity, and adverſity, to live in Chriſt. If like the Eagles you make your Neſt in this rock, <hi>your faith ſhall be your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi>

Then you were pleaſed to approve them, and now you will be pleaſed to love them more, becauſe they lye by you for daily uſe. There will many faults be found with them, as, brevity, plainneſſe, imperfection, and the like: but above all that, they want the living voice, and tender heart to ſet an edge upon them. As to the firſt faults, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them, and, in truth, I make this but as a fore-runner to a larger Catechiſm, thorough the whole body of Divinity. If God ſend me health, life, and leiſure, you may ſee that, (if this, mean while be acceptable to the Church) and it will more copiouſly handle all the
<pb facs="tcp:153032:16"/> grounds by way of <hi>explication, obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>caſes of conſcience,</hi> which are moſt obvious. As to the laſt fault, indeed it wants my voice, but not my heart. For when you are warming your own and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens hearts with it, I will follow it with my prayers to make it ſucceſſefull. Could I do more, I would do it: Could I do leſſe, I would not: As becomes him that hath been, is, and (by Gods bleſsing) will be, to both of you (worthy Ladies)</p>

No, no, thou muſt have faith, and thou muſt have a true, and a living faith, if thou wouldeſt have thy ſalvation by Chriſt. The faith that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary profeſſors at large dreame of, is an eaſie way to heaven. They may ſwallow downe all their ſins with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, and goe thither at an houres warning. It is but knowing and aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth of Chriſtianity, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon preſumptuous grounds, that Chriſt died for them, and they hope to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:153032:73"/> be ſaved by him, as well as the preciſeſt of them all. But thou wilt find it an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der worke to have a true <hi>faith of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi> For thou mayſt find that when ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are brought into the ſtraits of death, ſometimes they <hi>can not beleeve,</hi> and ſometimes they <hi>dare not beleeve.</hi> They can not beleeve for their lives, as <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who cried out, <hi>that he could no more beleeve then the Devill.</hi> If a man will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver runne, he will runne, when he runs for his life: and if a man will ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, he will beleeve, when he beleeves for his life. But poore ſinners when the ſight of their owne unworthineſſe, and Satans temptations are let looſe upon them, can not beleeve for their lives. Sometimes they dare not beleeve, as wicked Chriſtians, who ſee they muſt loſe all if they beleeve in Chriſt. They muſt loſe <hi>father, mother, wife, children, houſes, lands,</hi> and all ſublunary content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they beleeve in Chriſt.

<note place="margin"> Act. 1.</note> How is thy ſoul perplexed.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that thou muſt labour to be fully perſwaded: for God ſaith,

                        <hi>make thy calling, and election ſure:</hi> and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to faith to work this full perſwaſion, in Gods people, at many turnes: but there is a vaſt difference betwixt the working of faith in it ſelf, and the work of it in thee. Thy handkerchief, band, cuffs, or any part of thy linnen may be very white, yet put it into an Ink-pot and it will ſoon be made black. So true faith works full perſwaſion of it ſelf: but put it into thy heart, where there is too much fleſh, and unbelief, and doubting, and ſelf-policy, and the work of faith is too much, too long, too often hindred, which makes thee cry out, <hi>Lord I beleeve, help my unbeleef.</hi> Beſides, nothing can work this full perſwaſion but faith: for faith is an argument to conclude it. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin"> Ephe. 1.13.</note> that <hi>after ye beleeved ye were ſealed with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit of promiſe:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay,

<note place="margin"> Mat. 16.18</note> Chriſt is called <hi>A Rock</hi> oftentimes in the Scripture.

                        <note place="margin"> 1 Cor. 10.16.</note> by the court of Record in the Scriptures, in the kingdome of the great King of heaven and earth. The manner of this conveyance is <hi>ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> that is, as a ſigne and ſeal. For it doth not convey Chriſt as I can convey money to thy purſe, or hand; or as cloaths to thy back by naturall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but as Sacraments can convey him: that is, they can ſignifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Chriſt, and ſeal it unto thee by the covenant and ordinance of God.</p>

                        </label> Therefore let me charge thee (my good childe) to prize this truth as a ſeal upon thy heart, and a ſignet upon thy right
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153032:84"/> hand. Wert thou not moſt miſerable if thou wert not in covenant with God? If he did not take thee into ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection as thy God? If thou didſt not engage thy ſelf to be one of his people who have illumination, forgiveneſſe, ſanctification, and perſeverance? All this God doth aſſure thee of in the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the Sacrament. Would'ſt thou not account thy ſelf in a ſad condition if God had made thee a promiſe of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt, and, when thou art bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off by the ſin of thy heart, thou hadſt no confirmation of it from the God of truth? yet, this is confirmed by the ſeal of the Sacrament. Would it not adde to thy ſaddeſt thoughts, If thou hadſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes of comfort by Chriſt, and yet hadſt no performances? Behold, the ſeale of the Sacrament doth convey Chriſt unto thy ſoul by faith. Is it not regiſtred in the Records of heaven, that <hi>this bread is my body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Luk. 22. 1 Cor. 11.</note> this <hi>wine is my bloud</hi> as Chriſt hath witneſſed? Hadſt thou but a cut finger, thou couldſt not have the vertue of the ſalve, to cure it, except thou hadſt the plaiſter of the ſalve it ſelf: nor canſt thou have the merits of Chriſt,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:153032:84"/> except thou haſt Chriſt himſelf, though not in a carnall way. Uſe the Sacrament as a <hi>ſigne</hi> to ſignifie; but let it be a ſigne, and not the proper thing ſignified. Uſe it as a ſeal; yet let it be but a ſeal to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a poſſeſſion of what thou haſt, though thou ſeeſt it not. Get poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and it is enough. In the mean time, turn thou this doctrine into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and plead with God from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Good father, let theſe ſignes ſignifie powerfully thy love to my ſoul. Let theſe ſeals be a ſweet concluſion of the covenant of Grace betwixt thee and me: be a confirmation to my doubting faith: and be a conveyance of Chriſt to me, that he may live in my ſoul by faith, and confound ſinne more and more, and quicken me to all Grace to thy Glory.</p>

If the Devill ſhould ſtand up in Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and plead; Great God, thou haſt done wonderfull works for this thy creature, and yet he doth diſhonour thee in thought, word, and deed.

If any work be wrought, if it be wrought baſely, and bunglingly, he that wrought it hath no credit by it. If it be wrought curiouſly, every man that paſſeth by takes notice of it, and praiſeth the workman. This is thy caſe. Thou art the workmanſhip of God.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe <hi>thine is Kingdome.</hi> Whether ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects go, but to them that have King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to free them from diſtreſſes?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>becauſe thine is power.</hi> Whether
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:153032:125"/> ſhould weaklings go but to power? Power will help weakneſſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, becauſe <hi>thine is Glory.</hi> If thou help me, thou wilt glorifie thy ſelf. If thou help me, I ſhall glorifie thee.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thine is <hi>The</hi> Kingdom,
<note place="margin"> Pſal. 47. Pſal. 72.</note> 
                        <hi>The</hi> power, and <hi>The</hi> glory over all. For <hi>generality,</hi> God is King over all the earth, and for <hi>ſuperiority,</hi> all Kings ſhall fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Why ſhouldeſt thou not truſt to be heard by ſuch a God?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all theſe are thine <hi>for ever:</hi> for <hi>God onely hath immortality:</hi> therefore why ſhouldſt thou not depend upon him that lives for ever, and can help for ever? Theſe are thy reaſons.</p>
                     <p>The confident expectation of Gods anſwer is in this word, <hi>Amen:</hi> By this thou ſealeſt thy conſent, and doeſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>confidence.</hi> And <hi>thou</hi> muſt do it. For it is but a toy for one man to ſay the prayer onely, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man to ſay Amen. Amen is part of thy devotion, and all, both Miniſters and people, or all others, that pray muſt ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Noble Friends,</hi> God hath joyned you together by bloud, and marriage, and I durſt not ſeparate one from the other. It is all your goods I ayme at, and therefore I reſolved not to make one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to another for a gift, but all to bee thankefull to that Noble Mother, who ſet me on work. On my part, I can do
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:153032:131"/> nothing that may deſerve a publike eye: but if others think otherwiſe, I cannot help it. If they tell me that I have a talent; I have known that a long time. If they tell me it may profit by way of preaching, I muſt put that to the ſucceſſe which Gods bleſsing will give it. If they tell me it may profit by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, here onely I ſtick. I am altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what I can do in this kinde. I have nothing to direct me but others opinions and deſires: and if they be no ſure Cards and Compaſſes to ſail by into this cenſuring world, I may ſuffer ſhipwrack. Howſoever it fall out, I muſt now take my Lot, and if with <hi>Jonas</hi> I be caſt into the Sea, it is becauſe I have obeyed, and not becauſe I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled. It is poſsible for a man to know when he is called to do any work, though it be a work of hazard. He is called, ſurely, when he hath a voice from heaven to deſigne him as <hi>Paul</hi> had; and when he hath a particular inſtinct of ſpirit, as many worthies in the firſt ages; and when he hath the propheſies go of him, as <hi>Timothy</hi> had; and when he hath the approbation, and impoſition of hands of the Elderſhip, as ordinary ſervants of Chriſt for the benefit of the Church, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and Teachers have; or laſtly, when
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:153032:131"/> he hath the engagement of the hearts of Gods people attending upon his diſpenſing of the myſteries of grace, and preſsing the publike uſe of what he doth more privately. As I have had long ago, and ever ſince, ſome comfortable approbation at, and ſince the impoſition of hands, ſo have I had ſome clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the hearts of the godly, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the publike, of what I have done in this ſervice, in the private. This I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an invitation to do ſomething by the pen, as well as in the Pulpit. As I would not be ſo running out, as to make all my diviner thoughts viſible to the Sunne (becauſe there are many that can do it better): ſo would I not be ſo bound up, as to be unwilling to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſome in this way, though others may think it not worth the looking on. That which is as gold to ſome, may be as braſſe to others: and that which is as ſilver to ſome, is as lead to others: and yet variety of ſpirits may be helped according to various touches, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, of fancies, judgements, concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and opinions from the ſpirit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I therefore being emboldened to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this kinde, was not long to ſtudy to whoſe hands to preſent it firſt, and thence to have it derived to all <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:153032:132"/> hearts, that we are willing to receive it. To you therefore <hi>(my noble friends)</hi> is it come, onely craving your acceptance, according to the worth of the matter, not of the perſon that exhibits it unto you. I am a poor old man, clogged with many infirmities, who have been toſſed, and bandied up, and down in the world; who yet, want nothing but a fuller meaſure of Jeſus Chriſt to dwell in my ſoul by faith. I have learned you the fountains of ſecret ſinnes, and the means how to diſcover them in your ſelves, that it may bow you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of heaven, to make you fit to hold Jeſus Chriſt. It muſt be an hollow veſſel which muſt hold water, and an hollowed heart; that muſt lye under the fountain of <hi>David</hi> for ſin and for uncleanneſſe, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the water of life to the ſoul. I have taught you the worth of the Glorious Goſpel, that you may be willing to hunt after Chriſt, and, when you have found him, to part with all that is yours for his embracements. And, becauſe your precious ſouls are in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in theſe diſtracted dayes, both by proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and adverſity, I have learned you, from the beſt aſſurance office in the world, to ſecure your ſouls; that while you enjoy them you may have faith, while you have faith, you
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:153032:132"/> may have Chriſt, and while you have Chriſt, you may have the love of God for your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall good.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe, that if ever Chriſtian ſouls were in danger, they are in danger now. We are faln <hi>into the laſt, and perillous dayes:</hi> wherein while the Drum, and Canon are the beſt muſick, and Commiſsion is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſword to cut off not a few, and to guild the Land with crying bloud; the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſowes tares to an aboundance at home, to the hinderance of Reformation, and to the disjoynting of many a good ſoul. Some of the ancient exploded hereſies are revived; and ſuch wide ruptures are made, that a devout ſoul can ſcarce tell at which dore to go in to Chriſt: my heart bleeds to ſee with what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and violence private opinions are maintained. I beleeve that I may have ſome private opinion, of my own; but I will rather bury it within my breaſt, then ſuffer it to make a publike diſturbance. If others would do ſo too, we might (it may be) have been wafted to our wiſhed for haven before this day. But (alas) all cry up the ways of Chriſt, the ordinances of Chriſt, the Kingdome of Christ; but when it comes to be examined it is found to be nothing but ſelf opinions, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:153032:133"/> ſelf practiſes. Some look upon the Law as a School-maſter unto Chriſt, and, when they have learned him, they would walk in Chriſt, not onely by beleeving, but by doing, ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; charitable duties as the Law propounds and commands. Some would have no uſe of the Law among Chriſtians, but pin all upon faith, as if faith did not work by love. Some look upon Baptiſm as unuſefull in our Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, though the beginning of it cannot be concludently grounded but from the Apoſtles, and the practiſe of it was never oppoſed till this laſt age. Some are for the grafting of it into the place of Circumciſion; becauſe it can be no other then that was, <hi>A ſigne and ſeal of the righteouſnes of faith:</hi> and God, <hi>who caleth things that are not as if they were,</hi> calleth, by vertue of his Covenant, Infants of Chriſtians <hi>Believers,</hi> much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infants of Jews. Some again are for Congregationall Churches onely, as if Chriſt had given any ſuch precept, or as if there were any ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe according to undoubted rule. Others will have Claſsicall Churches under ſweet and amiable ſubordination to help the Communion of Saints, as in the dayes of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Some would have excommunication in the power of the whole Body; ſome in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:153032:133"/> power of the Presbytery; ſome in the power of a mixt Presbytery, ſome of an Elderſhip of Miniſtery, which ſeemes to be the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way; and ſome would have none at all, though, happly, if excommunication be not a <hi>delivering over to Satan;</hi> yet it may, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be a wary <hi>caſting out,</hi> and removing ſtones of offence till they are humbled, and reformed. Some would have all puniſhments in the power of the Magiſtrate; ſome would have none but for ſuch faults as claſh againſt Publique Peace of the Common-wealth: though it cannot be denied, but that the ſword of a good Magiſtrate, for vertue, and againſt vice is a back of Steele to a good Miniſtery. Some are for admittance of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church by I know not what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (becauſe it is variouſly practiſed). Others know no covenant but that of grace, made in Baptiſme, and renewed in the Supper of the Lord, except voluntary Covenants, and according to the Rules of Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Now <hi>(my much honoured friends)</hi> when theſe digladiations are ſharpned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt good men, great men, will it not be a beame in the eye of many a good ſoul, even to hinder them from walking with ſuch a ſteady foot, in the wayes of Chriſt, as were to be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:153032:134"/> wiſhed? I know no better way to help all, then to follow <hi>Melancthons</hi> counſell to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when ſhe was troubled with the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of her time, <hi>that ſhe ſtick to her old principles of ſaving doctrine, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,</hi> and for the reſt to wait the iſſue of Gods providence. This is my humble, and hearty counſell to you all. Look upon the goodneſſe of every good man, and ſo far as you ſee Chriſt in them, ſo far honour, and ſuccour them: but for other opinions engage you not. It will be more unſeemly at laſt to caſt out an errour, upon further triall, then not to admit it at firſt. God hath his mighty work in theſe ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, for the cleering of ſome truths, yet, more confuſedly known. When this is brought unto an iſſue, it will more ſweetly content you, then a preſent engagement in the premiſes of many ſtirring ſpirits who do too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves and others. This is all I ayme at, and therefore preſent you with old quiet grounds of faith, and practiſe, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth me who am the ſervant of Jeſus Christ, and under him</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It may be demonſtrated, and we may be aſſured that we know not our errours three ways. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>by our ſecurity.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> How we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that we know not our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

As ſinners put farre from them the evill day: ſo they put as farre as they can from them the ſight of ſinne. When they do it they are loath to ſee what they do, becauſe it is a work of darkneſſe.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:153032:147"/> it into the Country, as farre as they can; becauſe they would not ſee it themſelves nor ſuffer others to ſee it. But bring it to a neerneſſe, and that which ſeemed no ſinne will appeare to be a ſinne, and what ſeemed a little one will be a very great. A man upon the top of an high hill, looks as little as a childe, but bring him down, and you ſhall ſee his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So bring ſinne to a preſent view, as it wounds the conſcience, defaceth Gods image, and hindereth our traffick with our God, we ſhall ſee it big enough to a miracle in it ſelf, and all the brats, and broods of many ſecret ones which are as a retinue, and hangs upon it.</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> thou maiſt finde them out, by declining ſuch ways as bring the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon thy ſoul.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:153032:148"/> leſt they ſee with their eyes, hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and be converted.</hi> Even ſo, it is a lamentable thing that Gods judgement ſhould ſeal thy eyes up, from ſeeing thy ſinnes: for then thou maiſt ſuddainly be waſted, and made deſolate, and removed farre away from God. Therefore if thou would'ſt diſcover thy ſecret ſinnes keep off this judgement of God by ſinning againſt conſcience. Conſcience is Gods deputy: and the affront that is offered unto it, is offered to God, who gave it authority over thee. Sinne againſt it, and thou ſinneſt againſt Gods officer; and God cannot but take it as an unworthy act. It makes him angry, brings his judgement, and then where art thou? Thy eyes are blinded, thy heart is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, thy ſinnes, like Philiſtims, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, and thou ſeeſt them not.

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>rareneſſe.</hi> Pearls are not to be found in every ground, nor Chriſt in every ſoul. How many thouſands are there where Chriſt dwels not? It is as impoſſible not to ſee a lighted Candle in a clear Lanthorn, as not to ſee Chriſt thorough the actions and motions of the body, if he dwell in the ſoul. But alas, in how few is he diſcovered by life!</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>the adorning</hi> quality. Pearls are accounted the greateſt ornament; but a pearl of great price is a greater yet: therefore do you hang them out, on head, throat, breaſts, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. So nothing is ſuch an ornament to a Chriſtian,
<note place="margin"> Eph. 3.</note> as <hi>Chriſt dwelling in his heart by faith.</hi> As <hi>Albinus,</hi> for his worth, was called <hi>Englands</hi> Library: <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the eye of his time: <hi>Melancthon,</hi> the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix of <hi>Germany: Auguſtine</hi> the Mallet of Hereticks: ſo Chriſt is called the <hi>Glory of Iſrael. Simeon</hi> could ſee in him nothing but ſalvation, when hee was a childe. Talk not of other pearls; this is that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one: therefore <hi>Paul deſired to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:153032:160"/> at Corinth, but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In reſpect of the <hi>preciouſneſſe</hi> of Chriſt, pearles are accounted the moſt precious of things: and a thouſand worlds cannot procure Chriſt where he is not. All gold, and gaine cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his miraculous gifts;
<note place="margin"> Act. 8.</note> much leſſe himſelfe, and his invaluable merits.</p>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>the breeding of pearles.</hi> If Naturaliſts ſay true (as all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of all ſides obſerve) pearles are bred in ſhelfiſh, which lye gaping in the ayre. This ayre breeds theſe pearles, and by how much purer the ayre is that blowes then, by ſo much more pure, and generous are the pearles. So, If I ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Gal. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>My little children, of whom I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in birth again, till Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> you will aske me two queſtions; <hi>What is meant by Chriſts forming in you?</hi> and, <hi>How he is formed?</hi> By forming of Chriſt in you, you may underſtand the framing of your Judgements, affections, and actions into the Image of Chriſt.

<note place="margin"> Eſa. 53.</note> You <hi>know this righteous ſervant</hi> to Juſtifie you, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:153032:160"/> know <hi>this Sonne Jeſus Chriſt to eternall life.</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Joh. 17.3.</note> You love him as the Saviour of his Church, and Head of his Body, and put your whole <hi>truſt</hi> in him for all the worke which his Father committed to him to doe. And you doe (though not with equall paces) as Chriſt your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band did in all Morall Actions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of grace given. And now when men look upon you in your ſtate, and courſe, they may ſay, that you are as like Chriſt as if you were <hi>ſpit out of his mouth,</hi> as we phraſe it in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb: Yea, and you may ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                        <hi>I live, but not I, but Chriſt lives in me by faith.</hi> If you would know, how Chriſt is thus formed in you? You open your mouth wide by enlarged deſires going after him,
<note place="margin"> Joh. 3.</note> and <hi>the winde that goeth where it liſteth, and no man knows whence it comes, and whether it goes,</hi> that is, the ſpirit of the Father, and of the Sonne, the holy Ghoſt, works it by the Goſpel: and by how much more purely it blows, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermixture of your fleſh, by ſo much more you are unlike to your ſelves, and like to Chriſt this pearle of great price.</p>

                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Chriſt may well be called this pearle of great price; In reſpect of the <hi>Compariſon</hi> betwixt the beſt earthly pearles, and the pearle Chriſt. Earthly pearles make richer, but no better: for <hi>they that will be rich fall into temptation,</hi>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:153032:165"/> perſon that trades for it, is Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man, who is no baſe one.
